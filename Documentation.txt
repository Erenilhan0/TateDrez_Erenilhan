I separated the game into phases with the Event System. 


There are 4 phases in the game: the dice roll phase to choose who to start, 
the chess piece placement phase, the game phase, and the level end phase.


I changed the Dynamic mode a little bit. As I read in the document you sent, 
if X player can't move, the other player moves twice but since the game board is not that big 
and moves are very limited on the board it stucks when the other player has only one available move, 
the other player goes to the available board part and returns to the starting position. 


Instead, if x player can't move, the other player enters the Dynamic mode and stays in the 
Dynamic mode unless x player can move.


Also, the player is not able to place the knight in the center of the board. 
Because there are no possible moves when the knight is placed in the center and after playing the game for a while 
it feels like stealing the fun and puzzle sense of the game.
